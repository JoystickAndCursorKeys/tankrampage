#structures (s:structure number,structure name, indexed directionalblocks)
# explanation:
#  index meaning left=1,right=2,up=4,down=8 (horizontal struct would be left+right=1+2=3)
#  Index of first block is 0, second=1, third=2
#   so first block(=0) means no block, second block(=1) means, struct coming from left, going to nowhere
#   .... 16th block (=15) means, going up,down, left and right (a cross)
